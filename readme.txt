A super easy way to redirect a user to another page when viewing a post/page on your site.

== Description ==
Shortcode Redirect allows site owners to automatically redirect a user when viewing a page or post on the site. The plugin instructions are very simple. Add a shortcode to the post/page that looks like the following `[redirect url='http://somesite.com']` the url= part is where you define the URL to redirect the user to.

= Features =
* Works on pages and posts
* NO settings or configurations to deal with
* Define a URL to redirect the user to

== Installation ==
1. Upload 'shortcode-redirect.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Add the shortcode on the pages/posts that you want to redirect. Shortcodes should look like `[redirect url='http://somesite.com']` where the url= part is the URL to redirect to.

4. Done!

Shortcode redirect should work with older versions of WordPress as well but was not tested with anything older than 2.7
